X marks the spot.  that is the only safe spot.  follow it quickly in order.  it is the only path in the bullet maze.

Layered loop.

	10 Many rectangles move from any side of screen?

random side, random position.
sum of seconds loops.
offset quarter second between loop.

Release key. snap to cell
wierd.

Matrix of rows and columns.
Array of rows and array of columns.
Count spawn.  When row and column reaches a threshold, spawn there on next collision of boxes there and reset to 0.
pickup only appears after boxes pass by.
upon spawn the row or column is known.
upon intersection, the target coordinate can be deduced.  the speed varies.
pickup can be attached to each bullet and checked for collision with other pickup.  this is tiny.
player collision can be larger than it looks, and bullet smaller than it looks.  

collision of 128 x 128 would be about 16184 calls.

if only rows and columns may collide, check these.
only a diagonal relationship between time of spawn with orthogonal side indicates a collision.
example:

     01
    0..
    1..

0x0 collides, 1x1 collides.
these would also collide:  0x1, 1x0

      01
      ..
     0..
   1....

The center of these would not collide:

      0
      .1
     0..
    1...

history of spawns is known.
because speed changes, the future position may vary.

Simeon may expect a warning before speed up.
	fade before speed?
	anticipation before adjust?
	tween?
Simeon may expect to restart ramp up to higher intensity.
Simeon expects to notice additional instructions if scrolling down the page.
